# 🚀 My DSA Journey  

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning space! 🌱  
This repository is my **personal roadmap** where I practice, organize, and track my problem-solving progress.  
Every folder represents a new milestone in my journey to mastering **DSA & Competitive Programming** 💻✨

## 📂 Folder Structure
📘 `01_BASIC` → Basic programming problems  
🔢 `02_PATTERN_LOGIC` → Pattern printing challenges  
🧮 `03_BASIC_MATH` → Math-based problems  
🔁 `04_BASIC_RECURSION` → Recursion practice  
⚡ `05_SORTING_TECHNIQUE` → Sorting algorithms  
📚 `06_STL` → Standard Template Library exercises
### 07_Binary Number
- Binary → Decimal Conversion  
- Decimal → Binary Conversion
🗂️ `08_ARRAYS` → Array-based problems
